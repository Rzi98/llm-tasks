6640," I agree, he is a great actor too bad he doesnt star in drama movies anymore",Surprised
8383," NBA stars wear funny looking sneakers, and that doesn't seem to bother them. Probably because it comes with a nice paycheck.

7111," Oh boy, I don't believe I'd be too interested in traveling to The Super bowl. Far too much testosterone for a woman like myself. I'm kind of pulling for The Rams simply because they have been the chosen ones lol. I find it interesting so many people aspire to play in The NFL while engineers still make more loot in the long run than players do.

Travel is the movement of people between distant geographic locations and can be down by foot, bicycle, car, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage and can be one way or round trip.",Curious to dive deeper
8128," True, but it seems that politicians are locked into their own fantasies. For example, Indonesia's president has released 3 pop albums while in office. This is the way to a successful musical career? Seems like a distraction. ",Neutral

909," And in that time, we've managed to destroy 80 percent of the natural forests. So sad!",Sad
2501," Yes, but also due to the differences in the evolution. I also enjoy watching Aves ( Birds) movies. The soundtracks of the birds in flight is always fascinating.

943," No, I never learned to play piano.  But, I would like to learn.",Curious to dive deeper
7624," I wonder that too, do you remember the old rotary phones? I guess 212 is the fastest number you can dial on them and that's why it is still New York's area code",Curious to dive deeper
7223," My guess is he got the GED, but could you imagine?  I do know he has done some unusual things like visit Drake University in the middle of the night, so maybe he surprised a high school class.",Curious to dive deeper

6704,Unreal! Can you believe that NYC area code is 212 because it was the fastest to dial?,Surprised
879," True, but More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed",Angry

8344,Eddie Murphy is classic.,Neutral
4486,Is it because of its roots in folk music?,Curious to dive deeper

3519," We had to do it for a year, and then it was a elective.  Most of us were young teenage boys and had zero interest in it.  We thought it was not much better than a literature class.",Neutral
6146," So you think that was all an act? Perhaps. But it's also possible the hairdo was just her trying to look good since it was a very formal setting, and the nuances of her voice were likely due to the emotions her testimony evoked. I think a victim sounding like a scared girl is more likely than a grown man keeping decades-old calendars. What college student actually writes in parties on a calendar, anyway?",Curious to dive deeper

2973,Most kids are weak in high school and subject to peer pressure.  We've all done stupid things.,Neutral
